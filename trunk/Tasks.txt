Mayor tasks
- Inter-Proxy-Protocol
	- Async requests ??
		- We need a listener for responses from the RP at the LP side
		- RP requests management (IDs, save from which LP request came, ...)
	- Cancel request
	- Detect network outage
		- Restart interrupted downloads
- Cache
	- caching larger granularity (lower priority)
		- intelligent eviction, timeout, etc. (also for subcomponents)
	- Directory hashes - better solution ideas?
	- Cache problems with POST and subsequent requests. E.g. user is logged in but gets old page.
	  - Per user cache:
		- User must be logged in into Trotro to do POSTs
		- While logged in, after a POST with a setcookie-header in the response, create a per user-cache for the specific domain, and use that instead of global cache.
		- Delete this when user logs out.
- Add/RequestWithoutUser redesign
  - Either
    - GET -> Redirect to Trotro or
    - POST -> Stream transparently or
	  -> Redirect to /request/add directly
	  -> make /request/add redirect to index.html
	  -> See if old (GET) redirect doesn't work for other pages, too.

Minor tasks
- Use unix file names to support longer file names: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/archive/2007/02/13/long-paths-in-net-part-1-of-3-kim-hamilton.aspx
- Limit outgoing requests like incoming (_activeRequests)
- Do not delegate remove if request is undispatched or finished 
- Queue also streaming requests at the RP ??
	- Duplicate IsStreaming()-Check at the moment.
- RequestHandlers are considered equal, if URL is equal. They should not be equal if HTTP method is different or body (for POSTs e.g.) is different.
- DNS cache hit/miss logging (César: Packet sniffing)
- Domain name & Search query clustering
- Handle 304 correctly (done for StreamTransparently, missing for DownloadToCache, but it doesn't seem to happen there)
- When getting file from cache, only read file ONCE! (Do that after cache restructuring)
- Configure Windows Firewall correct and write an article in the Wiki.
- How to react to other server responses than 200 (e.g. 500), if the content is still useful?
- If a request failed, provide more information (Server error (statuscode) vs. RC error (reason))
- Create more sub-namespaces and restructure the .cs files.

Code piece integration
- Clustering:
	- Make cache access (cluster, add, remove) synchronized. (Maybe both after restructuring cache, otherwise we might have to do it again.)
- Link recommendation
- Crawler
	- Run crawler button in UI, to build a download a cache based on predefined topics.

Metrics logging
- Save IP per userId (done)
- login/logout request (just let the server know) (done)
  - sync cookie timeout and server "session" timeout
- log all requests (done)
  - per user (done)
- log every RC request?
- self reported user satisfaction
  - html form before or after logout
  - request for the server that logs this
- total number of cached objects (done, commented out)
- network speed + status (when detection is implemented)

Tests
- Test metadata restoring: POST requests
- Test search avg. time with >100 local search results
- Test if queue works for offline network status.

Bugs
- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas*! (bad chars...)
- "Failed finishing the search work item due to timeout." Indexer:809
- HttpListenerException (close browser window) uncatched. (Hard to reproduce)
- http://jsfiddle.net/mpRmV/5/
- InvalidDataException in GzipWrapper:121  
- LevelNIndex fails if clustering was aborted. e.g. Clusters.cs: 531
- Unpack bug !?
	- http://ros.org/wiki/tf 
- Trotro
  - sometimes "Pending" does not update to "Downloading". Could be Trotro or RC bug.
  - When clicking next on either local or google results, the other results should not be loaded again.
  - needs F5 to show page is ready sometimes (can't reproduce this...)
  - always opens in first tab! 
  - Login mechanism does not work correct
  - Embed opened pages instead of new tabs. Page inside main frame. At the moment, if you do that, you end up having Trotro inside Trotro .... (not sure we can fix this one.)
  - Click search results makes links open in the TroTro tab, this is inconsistent with opening in a new tab. (fixed for cached results, the problem with new results is that it gets redirected to the queue. this should be changed so the RCproxy filters out live results that are actually cached)
