- Inter-Proxy-Protocol
	- Async requests ??
		- We need a listener for responses from the RP at the LP side
		- RP requests management (IDs, save from which LP request came, ...)
	- Detect network outage
		- Restart interrupted downloads
- Cache
	- caching larger granularity (lower priority)
		- intelligent eviction, timeout, etc. (also for subcomponents)
	- Directory hashes - better solution ideas?

Tasks
- Implement offline detection + back online detection.
- Long file name support. See http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/archive/2007/02/13/long-paths-in-net-part-1-of-3-kim-hamilton.aspx and http://zetalongpaths.codeplex.com/
- At first hardcoded percentage of _maxInflightRequests that have to be non-streamed ones.
- Queue also streaming requests at the RP ??
	- Duplicate IsStreaming()-Check at the moment.
- DNS cache hit/miss logging (César: Packet sniffing)
- Domain name & Search query clustering
- Handle 304 correctly (done for StreamTransparently, missing for DownloadToCache, but it doesn't seem to happen there)
- How to react to other server responses than 200 (e.g. 500), if the content is still useful?
- Create more sub-namespaces and restructure the .cs files.
- "Search later when I'm online" functionality.
- Blacklist an URL being requested more than 10 times in an interval shorter than 10s.
- Login/security
  - Save pseudo-randomly generated session id in the cookie, not the user id
- https
  - _maxInflightRequests
  - Install directions.

Bugs
- Estimated network speed is sometimes negative!?
- If there are two local networks (LAN + Wifi), not the right one might be used to measure download speed.
- "DB file does not exist" when clicking a (Wikipedia) hyperlink in offline mode (Aaron).
- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas*! (bad chars...)
- http://jsfiddle.net/mpRmV/5/
- InvalidDataException in GzipWrapper:121
- Trotro
  - Inconsistent vertical spacing of the link suggestion box.
  - Sometimes "Pending" does not update to "Downloading". Is Trotro bug, as queue.xml has "Downloading".
  - When clicking next on either local or google results, the other results should not be loaded again.
  - Embed opened pages instead of new tabs. Page inside main frame. At the moment, if you do that, you end up having Trotro inside Trotro .... (not sure we can fix this one.)
  - Click search results makes links open in the TroTro tab, this is inconsistent with opening in a new tab. (fixed for cached results, the problem with new results is that it gets redirected to the queue. this should be changed so the RCproxy filters out live results that are actually cached)

Code piece integration
- Crawler
	- Run crawler button in UI, to build a download a cache based on predefined topics ?
	- Integrate the database creation into the crawler.
	- Integrate new URL<->Filepath conversion into the crawler.

Metrics logging (done)
- Save IP per userId (done)
- login/logout request (just let the server know) (done)
  - sync cookie timeout and server "session" timeout (done)
- log all requests (done)
  - per user (done)
- self reported user satisfaction (done)
- total number of cached objects (done)
- number of registered users (done)
- network speed + status (done)
