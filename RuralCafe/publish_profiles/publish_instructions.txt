=== Publishing ===

For each of the 4 profiles:
  - Copy the contents of the profile folder into /trunk/RuralCafe, overriding files.
  - Right click RuralCafe in the SolutionExplorer, choose Properties, go to the Publish Tab
  - Adjust version number (at least revision) and click "Publish now".
  - For offline:
    - A folder /trunk/RuralCafe/publish has been created. Put that folder into a (self-extracting) archive and upload it somewhere.


Remember:
If you update the publish configuration, add, delete or modify default settings, or do anything that affects the files included in the profile folders,
you must update the profile folders then by merging the files somehow.
