Mayor tasks
- Inter-Proxy-Protocol
	- Cancel request
	- Detect network outage
		- Restart interrupted downloads
- Cache
	- caching larger granularity
		- intelligent eviction, timeout, etc. (also for subcomponents)
	- Directory hashes - better solution ideas?
	- Include metadata in cache
		- (download time, headers?, lastrequesttime, #requests) in a priority queue or something. (For clustering priorization...)
		- Remove dirty redirect when metadata is included
	- Cache problems with POST and subsequent requests. E.g. user is logged in but gets old page.
	  - Per user cache?
- Add/RequestWithoutUser redesign
  - Either
    - GET -> Redirect to Trotro or
    - POST -> Stream transparently or
	  -> Redirect to /request/add directly
	  -> make /request/add redirect to index.html
	  -> See if old (GET) redirect doesn't work for other pages, too.

Minor tasks
- DNS cache hit/miss logging (César: Packet sniffing)
- Domain name & Search query clustering 
- Measure download speed correctly (see http://stuff.seans.com/2009/01/05/using-httpwebrequest-for-asynchronous-downloads/ ). Too fast at the moment.
- Handle 304 correctly.
- When getting file from cache, only read file ONCE!
- Configure Windows Firewall correct and write an article in the Wiki.
- How to react to other server responses than 200 (e.g. 500), if the content is still useful?
- If a request failed, provide more information (Server error (statuscode) vs. RC error (reason))
- Rewrite the internal XML requests (queue, cache search, ...) with XMLDocument, rather than building the xml string manually.
- Create more sub-namespaces and restructure the .cs files.

Code piece integration
- Clustering:
  - Create TextFiles and docfile on the fly?
  - Make cache access (cluster, add, remove) synchronized
  - Create 3-level-hierarchy from cluto's binary tree. (Maybe after restructuring cache, otherwise we might have to do it again.)
- Link recommendation
  - Firefox extension that sends request to server on link mouseover.
- Crawler

Metrics logging
- Save IP per userId (done)
- login/logout request (just let the server know) (done)
  - sync cookie timeout and server "session" timeout
- log all requests (done)
  - per user (done)
- log every RC request?
- self reported user satisfaction
  - html form before or after logout
  - request for the server that logs this
- total number of cached objects (done, commented out)
- network speed + status (when detection is implemented)

Tests
- Test metadata restoring: POST requests
- Test search avg. time with >100 local search results
- Test if queue works for offline network status.

Bugs
- "Failed finishing the search work item due to timeout." Indexer:809
- HttpListenerException (close browser window) uncatched. (Hard to reproduce)
- http://jsfiddle.net/mpRmV/5/
- InvalidDataException in GzipWrapper:121  
- Trotro
  - "User doesn't exist" design flaw
  - 2x download click might be necessary
  - needs F5 to show page is ready sometimes
  - always opens in first tab!
  - Do NOT send queue.xml without userid!
  - Way too many ETA requests!
  - Don't show "fetching results from internet", for empty searches, because nothing is done!
  - Always show local AND google search. Remove arrow if searching or design page properly.
  - Login mechanism does not work correct
  - Wait time not visible if title long and takes 2 rows
