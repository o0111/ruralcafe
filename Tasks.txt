Tasks
- Use the new URL<->Filepath conversion!
- Implement offline detection + back online detection.
- Long file name support. See http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/archive/2007/02/13/long-paths-in-net-part-1-of-3-kim-hamilton.aspx and http://zetalongpaths.codeplex.com/
- Handle 304 correctly (done for StreamTransparently, missing for DownloadToCache, but it doesn't seem to happen there)
- "Search later when I'm online" functionality.
- Request pages in higher quality.
- Login/security
  - Save pseudo-randomly generated session id in the cookie, not the user id
- https
  - _maxInflightRequests (?)
  - Connections don't get closed.
  - blacklist?
- NetworkSpeedDetection / InflightRequests Control
  - At first hardcoded percentage of _maxInflightRequests that have to be non-streamed ones. Better fairness policy later.
- Crawler
  - Return to the settings form when the crawler is closed
  - Improve classifier accuracy (currently 59 %)
  - Default blacklist
  - Possibly merge (Generate Training Set + Download Seed + Crawl), at least the first two.
- Deployment
  - Use another FTP server
  - Ask the user for updates regularly, not only when he is starting the program. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/system.deployment.application.applicationdeployment.aspx

Bugs
- Estimated network speed is sometimes negative!?
- If there are two local networks (LAN + Wifi), not the right one might be used to measure download speed.
- "DB file does not exist" when clicking a (Wikipedia) hyperlink in offline mode (Aaron).
- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas*! (bad chars...)
- http://jsfiddle.net/mpRmV/5/
- InvalidDataException in GzipWrapper:121
- Trotro
  - Inconsistent vertical spacing of the link suggestion box.
  - Sometimes "Pending" does not update to "Downloading". Is Trotro bug, as queue.xml has "Downloading".
  - When we're busy, queue items get deleted, but with a big delay.
  - When clicking next on either local or google results, the other results should not be loaded again.
  - Embed opened pages instead of new tabs. Page inside main frame. At the moment, if you do that, you end up having Trotro inside Trotro .... (not sure we can fix this one.)
  - Click search results makes links open in the TroTro tab, this is inconsistent with opening in a new tab. (fixed for cached results, the problem with new results is that it gets redirected to the queue. this should be changed so the RCproxy filters out live results that are actually cached)
