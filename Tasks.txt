Mayor tasks
- Inter-Proxy-Protocol
	- Async requests ??
		- We need a listener for responses from the RP at the LP side
		- RP requests management (IDs, save from which LP request came, ...)
	- Detect network outage
		- Restart interrupted downloads
- Cache
	- caching larger granularity (lower priority)
		- intelligent eviction, timeout, etc. (also for subcomponents)
	- Directory hashes - better solution ideas?

Minor tasks
- Use unix file names to support longer file names: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bclteam/archive/2007/02/13/long-paths-in-net-part-1-of-3-kim-hamilton.aspx
- Limit outgoing requests like incoming (_activeRequests)
- At first hardcoded percentage of _maxInflightRequests that have to be non-streamed ones.
- Queue also streaming requests at the RP ??
	- Duplicate IsStreaming()-Check at the moment.
- RequestHandlers are considered equal, if URL is equal. They should not be equal if HTTP method is different or body (for POSTs e.g.) is different.
- DNS cache hit/miss logging (César: Packet sniffing)
- Domain name & Search query clustering
- Handle 304 correctly (done for StreamTransparently, missing for DownloadToCache, but it doesn't seem to happen there)
- Configure Windows Firewall correct and write an article in the Wiki.
- How to react to other server responses than 200 (e.g. 500), if the content is still useful?
- If a request failed, provide more information (Server error (statuscode) vs. RC error (reason))
- Create more sub-namespaces and restructure the .cs files.
- "Search later when I'm online" functionality.
- Blacklist an URL being requested more than 10 times in an interval shorter than 10s.

Code piece integration
- Clustering
- Link recommendation
- Crawler
	- Run crawler button in UI, to build a download a cache based on predefined topics ?
	- Integrate the database creation into the crawler.

Metrics logging
- Save IP per userId (done)
- login/logout request (just let the server know) (done)
  - sync cookie timeout and server "session" timeout
- log all requests (done)
  - per user (done)
- self reported user satisfaction (done)
- total number of cached objects (done, commented out, needs to be repeated in intervals)
- network speed + status (done)

Tests
- Test search avg. time with >100 local search results

Bugs
- Estimated network speed is sometimes negative!?
- "DB file does not exist" when clicking a (Wikipedia) hyperlink in offline mode (Aaron).
- en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas*! (bad chars...)
- "Failed finishing the search work item due to timeout." Indexer:809
- http://jsfiddle.net/mpRmV/5/
- InvalidDataException in GzipWrapper:121
- Trotro
  - Inconsistent vertical spacing of the link suggestion box.
  - Sometimes "Pending" does not update to "Downloading". Is Trotro bug, as queue.xml has "Downloading".
  - When clicking next on either local or google results, the other results should not be loaded again.
  - Embed opened pages instead of new tabs. Page inside main frame. At the moment, if you do that, you end up having Trotro inside Trotro .... (not sure we can fix this one.)
  - Click search results makes links open in the TroTro tab, this is inconsistent with opening in a new tab. (fixed for cached results, the problem with new results is that it gets redirected to the queue. this should be changed so the RCproxy filters out live results that are actually cached)
- wrong https links (e.g. http://https//twitter.com/ )

Webpage issues
- http://favstar.fm/users/ubershitfacts (Infinite requests for the same item)
- 9gag no images
- facebook, youtube -> blacklisted!?
- sometimes no css at all (chefkoch.de)
- myvideo.de
- albinoblacksheep.com: works fine but no flash/ Failed!?
  - Closed Sockets!!?
- web.de -> Pending
  - Login doesn't work
- gmx.net -> Pending
  - Login (CGI) doesn't work
- Trac (Authentication required) -> Fails
- MyTVToday -> Fails
- uni-bremen.de : Most subpages don't work (PHP?)
  - Search does not work
- Google Login doesn't work
